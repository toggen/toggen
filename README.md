- 👋 Hi, I’m @toggen
- 👀 I’m interested in sql, python, r, bash and maybe some powershell, but only on good days. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to eat spaghetti without getting my shirt wasted. 
- 💞️ Rather do stuff myself tbh. 
- 📫 How has to know, knows. Who wants to know, has to be able to find out.
